# Machine-Learning-Study
Code from a college study about finding the most suitable machine learning model for classify patient who would have hypertension arterial. In this study we use data named "Hipertension_Arterial_Mexico.csv" from Kaggle. we shuffle the order of patient data and seperate it in to the train-set(80%) and the test-set(20%). We use train-set to done Feature Pruning (removing some feature of patient data that doesen't effect to model result), done Model Tuning to find the optimal setting for parameter of each model. after we pick features of data for use to trianing model and have model with optimal setting, do model training by using train-set data and then test those trained model with test-set data and compair result that test-set have given.
